    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "(3) Use the default CountVectorizer options and report the f1 score (use metrics.f1_score) for a k nearest neighbors classifier; find the optimal value for k. Also fit a Multinomial Naive Bayes model and find the optimal value for alpha. Finally, fit a logistic regression model and find the optimal value for the regularization strength C using l2 regularization. A few questions:\n",

    "ANSWER:  \n",
    "I think that kNN is struggling with sparseness in the presense of high dimensionality. Even within a category, say \"space\", I would guess that different instances are not close at all geometrically. As a result, searching for nearest neighbors doesn't provide very good classification. Regarding Naive Bayes vs logistic regression, I believe the answer is in the training set size and generative vs. discriminative models. As a generative model, Naive Bayes more quickly approaches its asymptotic limit in accuracy. As a discriminative model, logistic regression takes longer to reach its asymptote, but given enough data, I believe it would outperform Naive Bayes. Finally, the logistic regression sum of squared weights are monotonically with the regularization parameter C, but neither linearly, exponentially, nor by a monomial, although the latter is the closest model."

    "There are certainly a few surprises to both tables. I am surprised that atheism and religion don't overlap more in general. For example, the word \"Christian\" has a higher weight in space or computer graphics than in atheism. The bigrams have many more surprises. \"Cheers kent\" shows up in both atheism and religion. This seems to almost certainly be an example of overfitting. I can't imagine that that phrase generalizes well at all. The bigrams also notably contain several common words. This seems to suggest to me overfitting again and that the training data size was insufficient for a feature space so vast. A final conclusion from the monograms could be that similar words like \"christian\" and \"christians\" should be bucketed together, probably with some regular expressions preprocessing."

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular.

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "The second and third examples are much more clear. Both are discussions about religion but contain numerous references to computer language (ex. `online`, `internet`, `site`, file types, read/write permissions, etc.). It's difficult to say with certainty how to handle this because even as a human I would have to spend a bit of time deciding whether these belong under religion or computer graphics. A quick naive idea is to strip out potentially confusing and overlapping words such as `email`, but I fear this would harm the accuracy overall, even if it might improve these edge cases. One problem may be that it is considering words such as `Mormon` to be common because there are many religious documents, so that word doesn't count for much in example three. This leads me to think that it could be useful to run a regular CountVectorizer as well as a tf-idf vectorizer and evaluate each ones probabilities to make a synthesized prediction."
